# Gaussian Quantum State Preparation with High-Level Quantum Algorithms Design

Welcome to the Gaussian Quantum State Preparation repository! This project is part of a hackathon focused on designing high-level quantum algorithms to prepare Gaussian quantum states efficiently. Gaussian states are essential in continuous-variable quantum computing, quantum optics, and quantum information processing. This repository contains the code, documentation, and resources to explore and implement quantum algorithms for Gaussian state preparation.

Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to design and implement high-level quantum algorithms for the preparation of Gaussian quantum states. Gaussian states are a class of quantum states that are fully characterized by their mean and covariance matrix. These states are widely used in quantum communication, quantum sensing, and quantum simulations. The challenge lies in efficiently preparing these states on quantum hardware while minimizing resource usage (e.g., qubits, gates, and circuit depth).
